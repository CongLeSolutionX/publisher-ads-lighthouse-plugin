# Move the top ad further down the page

## Overview

This audit ensures that the topmost ad slot is not too close to the top of the
initial viewport. Many ads are never viewed because users scroll past them
before they become viewable. By moving ad slots away from the very top of the
viewport, users are more likely to see ads before scrolling away.

## Recommendations

Relocate ads slots close to the top of the initial viewport further down the
page. As a general rule, the middle of the top-most ad slot should be a minimum
of 100px from the top of the viewport.

As an alternative, consider placing ads near the bottom of the viewport (right
above the fold). This position has shown the highest viewability rates from our
data.
